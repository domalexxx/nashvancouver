msgid "Have you ever added a Featured Image to a post and thought to yourself, 'I wish I could add more than one image this way'? Well, now you can. \"Featured Galleries\" mirrors the Featured Images functionality of WordPress. The only difference is that posts get an entire gallery rather than just a single image. These galleries behave almost exactly like Featured Images, and make use of  WordPress's built in Media Manager. Users can select images, define the order, and save the gallery, all through a simple drag-n-drop interface."

msgid "<strong>Note</strong>: This is not a plugin which will add galleries to your website. This is for theme developers. It handles the backend interface for creating featured galleries, and storing them. You will still need to build a gallery on your page templates."

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Just like WordPress comes with <code>get_post_thumbnail_id()</code> built-in, you can use <code>get_post_gallery_ids()</code> to call the Featured Gallery. It needs the post's ID, and will return a PHP array with the ID's of all images in the post's Featured Gallery. Additionally you can send a second argument, \"string\", which will cause the function to return a comma-delimited string instead of an array."

Also, if anyone wants to take a look at <code>admin.js</code>, which calls up the media manager, I feel like the way that I open it to the gallery-edit state could be improved. (Opens to<code>featured-gallery</code> state, plugs in pre-selected images, then changes state to <code>gallery-edit</code>, and plugs in pre-selected images. Couldn't get selection to transfer, so there's a weird flash as it propagates.)"
